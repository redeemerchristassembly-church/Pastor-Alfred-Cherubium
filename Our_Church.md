Redeemer Christ Assembly was started in April 2003 as the first Tamil Church in Brampton with the Pentecostal foundation by Pastor S. Alfred Cherubim and had been reaching out to the Tamil community in Brampton City who have come from Sri Lanka, India, Singapore etc. and settled down here.

Our regular Sunday Services, weekly Bible studies, House Meetings, Vigil Night Prayers from the inception brought many of them come to know the truth and accepted Jesus as their personal Saviour and received the immersion Baptism and the anointing of the Holy Spirit.

Our extended Ministry activities such as Weekly articles in the secular News Papers, Weekly TV Programs, Monthly “Jesus Heals” Prayer meetings and the Spiritual Books released during the last few years touched, encouraged and strengthened many Christians from other Churches and Non-Christians as well.

On matters of public interest on Education which are contrary to our Christian faith, we have initiated and raised our opinion and as a Church contacted our local MPP, Premier and even the Prime Ministers and expressed our protest in writing. On this matter we join hands with other Churches to fervently to pray God’s intervention on these crucial matters concerning the children.

We collaborate with other Churches and Ministries in many situations, in that our Pastor is a standing active member of the Tamil Pastors Fellowship of Canada and also an active member of the Brampton Ministerial Association. We invite other Pastors other Churches to come and share the Word of God and also receive Pastors who come from India and Sri Lanka to preach in our Church.

We have a Youth Group called “JIMS” (Jesus Is My Saviour) bring in the growing children to have fellowship and to give them a strong foundation to lead a God fearing life. Few of the children went through JIMS have entered Universities and are even working, hold on to the faith and stand as living testimonies. We are sure the present growing children will go through that club and be benefited.

Our Children Annually take part in the Bible Quiz and the Memory Verses contest Organized for all the Tamil Churches in GTA are have received awards mostly every year. Our Church also take part in the Annual all Churches Christmas program and extend our whole-hearted support. Our Church has taken part in the Annual distribution of JESUS FILM in Brampton area homes for the last five years consecutively organized by Brampton Prayer Group.

All Praise and Glory to our Good Lord Jesus Christ.
